# Omicron Variant Prediction using RNN Deep Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning model developed for predicting the prevalence of the Omicron variant of the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The model leverages protein values and other relevant features as inputs to accurately classify cases into two categories: "Cases with confirmed S-gene" and "Cases with confirmed SGTF." The primary objective of this project is to provide valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of the Omicron variant, which can be instrumental in tracking and controlling the spread of the virus.

## Background: Omicron Variant and S-gene Deletions

The Omicron variant is characterized by multiple mutations in the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, the Omicron variant has gained considerable attention due to the presence of mutations in the S-gene, which plays a vital role in the virus's ability to enter and infect host cells. In some cases, the Omicron variant exhibits S-gene deletions, resulting in the loss of specific regions within the spike protein.

The S-gene Target Failure (SGTF) is a key indicator of the Omicron variant. It is used as a marker to distinguish cases with confirmed S-gene deletions from those with the full S-gene. Detecting SGTF has become crucial in tracking the prevalence and emergence of the Omicron variant, enabling healthcare authorities to implement targeted public health measures.

## Data Source

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from "omic_data.csv," containing genomic data related to the Omicron variant. The data includes information on the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) region, specimen date, number of cases (n), percentage of cases with SGTF, total cases, confidence intervals, and other relevant attributes.

## Computational Tools and Deep Learning Methods

1. Python: The entire project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its rich libraries and support for data science and machine learning.

2. Pandas and NumPy: Pandas and NumPy libraries are employed for data manipulation and handling numerical operations efficiently.

3. scikit-learn: scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing tasks such as standardization of features using StandardScaler and train-test split for model evaluation.

4. Keras: Keras, a high-level deep learning library, serves as the backbone for building the RNN model. Its simplicity and powerful APIs enable seamless design and training of complex neural networks.

5. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): The RNN architecture is leveraged in this project due to its ability to capture sequential dependencies in time-series data. Each data point, represented as a time step, plays a crucial role in predicting the next data point, making it suitable for our time series-like dataset.

6. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): As a variant of RNN, LSTM is employed to address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems by utilizing gated cells. This ensures that the model can efficiently capture long-term dependencies in the data, critical for predicting the prevalence of the Omicron variant over time.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the input features using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on a similar scale. The data is then split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 split ratio.

The RNN deep learning model is constructed with an LSTM layer with 64 units, followed by a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function to perform binary classification. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

The performance of the model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities, its ability to correctly classify cases with SGTF, and any potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

## Conclusion

The RNN deep learning model developed in this project showcases promising results in predicting the prevalence of the Omicron variant based on protein values and other features. The model provides valuable insights into the presence of SGTF in the dataset, helping researchers and healthcare professionals in tracking and mitigating the spread of the Omicron variant.

## Future Directions

Future iterations of this project may include:
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance further.
- Exploring other deep learning architectures, such as Bidirectional LSTM, to capture additional context in the data.
- Integrating external datasets and features to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization.
- Deploying the model as a real-time prediction tool to aid in monitoring the Omicron variant's dynamics in real-world scenarios.
